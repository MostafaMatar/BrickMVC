##BrickMVC, lightweight java mvc micro web framework
BrickMVC is a lightweight, MVC, micro java web framework. It's developed as an educational project and it's not intended to be used commercially however, all contributions are welcome and all and I would love to see what you'll do with it

+Very Lightweight

###Planned Future Features

###How to use BrickMVC
You can use BrickMVC in your web projects using the .
following method.

####Use the quick start template
You can use the quick start template, HelloWorld, which contains a login page allowing you to enter a username and a password, a validation class that makes sure username exists and password is 4 to 8 characters long and redirects to failure page in case of invalid data, a service class that reads the username and saves it in the session to be displayed in a success page. </p>
It's the quickest way to get started and make sure all configurations are correct and it's very useful to study this template and how it works to be able to customize and figure out how to use the framework.
